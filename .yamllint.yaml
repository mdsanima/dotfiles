# Linter configuration for YAML files.  This tool uses a predefined set of
# rules to check source files for issues such as line length, trailing spaces,
# and indentation.  It is available as a Python based command line tool, and
# can also integrate with your editor of choice to display diagnostics info
# like warnings or errors from the YAML language server.  The diagnostic for
# this linter are based on the rules defined in this config file.  For more
# information about, refer to the official source code at:
#
#       https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint/
#
# The rules are still a work in progress and subject to change.  I still need
# to think about this configuration file, and for now this is a base template.
