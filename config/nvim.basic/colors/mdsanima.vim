" Custom MDSANIMA color theme.  This config is based on the default 'pablo' Vim
" color file.  Run this `vim -c 'edit $VIMRUNTIME/colors/pablo.vim'` command on
" the terminal for more information about and help.  This config color scheme is
" still work in progress and may change in the future.

" I still need to think about this and the Neovim configuration.  May be I
" should just use the default color scheme.  I think to setup the configuration
" with LazyVim or NormalVim.  I will need to test it.
